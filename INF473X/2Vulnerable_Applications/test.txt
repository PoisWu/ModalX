If we take a look at the stack organization from our fonction:
Using only 3 and the organisation of my stack:
/*Memory Stack
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
    buffer                                greeting_text
|                  256                 |     128                                             |                            |
*/

We are going to exploit it using the injection of a shell code as in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S0aBV-Waeo&t=1s usign the fact that we are copying buf (256) into our greeting_text
