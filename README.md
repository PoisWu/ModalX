# Modal-Hack, introduction 
This is my first course in cypersecurity. The course 
This course is  

- My first C, review a pointer in C.
- Learning to read finding solutions myself via stackoverflow and read the
  standard reference 


# Tutorial 1 | programming in C 
Pointer staff

# Tutorial 2 | Network Programming in C
Learning the TCP/UDP protocol
Implement `wget` with TCP socket a simple client-server with UDP socket. 

# Tutorial 3 | Concurrent Programming in C
Multi-thread programming. I implement two threads, one is for receiving the
packets and the other for sending the packets. 

# Tutorial 4 | Sniffing and IP spoofing

# Buffer overflow attack 
Hacking the box by buffer overflow vulnerability of `strcpy`. 

# TCP SYN Flooding
Sending tons of TCP syn request to realise Deny-of-Service attack. It is simple
but it illustrate well the Availability in CIA cybersecurity model.

# DNS Hi-jacking 
When a attacker realise a DNS hi-jacking,  attacker spoofs the DNS request from
user to DNS server and relies to the user a fake IP address to direct to a fake
website. The attacker can receive some sensetive information like password by
DNS hi-jacking.
